Mirantis Fuel, which is a member of the OpenStack Big Tent has already made
itself one of the leading installers for OpenStack and offers an pluggable
architecture that enable you to add new capabilities to your
environments. XenServer Fuel Plugin is aiming to enables use of the XenServer
open source hypervisor (versions greater than 6.5 SP1) as a Compute provider
with Mirantis OpenStack, in a commercially supportable way. To be more specific
we want to achieve the following major goals:

* Add customisation to the user interface
* Configuring OpenStack to use XenServer at install-time 
* Install required plugins and other pre-requisites
* Routing control networks to give access to dom0
* Update the XenServer OpenStack integration
* Replacing the test image

#### Customising the user interface

Mirantis Fuel is highly GUI-based. As a single web page application written in
JavaScript, user can easily choose OpenStack release, hypervisor type, network
or storage back-ends and extra OpenStack services like Murano or Sahara through a
wizard. More detailed specific settings can be configured in a list of
categorised settings tabs. You can even drag and drop the network interfaces.
Generally, in Fuel UI configuration has been redesigned to make it really
user-friendly.

Moreover, Mirantis Fuel even provides a control plane to let you customise the
UI. As long as you follow the schema like [openstack.yaml]
(https://github.com/openstack/fuel-web/blob/master/nailgun/nailgun/fixtures/openstack.yaml),
user can define their own OpenStack release. In Mirantis 8.0, user can even
define their own resource type with [components.yaml]
(https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Fuel/Plugins#Component_compatibility_registry).
In above screen shot, a hypervisor type "XenServer" is defined. And if you
choose it, the subsequent wizard and setting tabs will represent based on your
choice and the incompatible list described in components.yaml. This feature is
really useful because OpenStack setup is complicated and there are many
restrictions. With incompatible list, users will be prevented from making wrong
choices.

In addition to provide restriction, Mirantis also provide a way to add input to
web UI. In environment_config.yaml we define text fields to ask for XenServer
credential information because we need to ssh into XenServer hosts to apply
patches later on which will be presented to the user in the web UI.

#### Configuring use of XenServer

For now in Mirantis Fuel there are only three built-in hypervisor types which
are QEMU, KVM and VMWare: XenServer isn't included by default. Our solution will
perform the deployment with qemu as the hypervisor and configure to use
XenServer when all prerequisites have been settled down. Changing the hypervisor
type is quite straightforward, the below settings are added to
`/etc/nova/nova-compute.conf` and the Nova services restarted.

    [DEFAULT]
    compute_driver=xenapi.XenAPIDriver
    [xenserver]
    connection_url=http://169.254.0.1
    connection_username="root"
    connection_password="XENSERVER_PASSWORD"

But the timing to do the change might be tricky. Fortunately Mirantis Fuel
provides a flexible hook mechanism based on Puppet task dependencies. Once it is
done, the new hypervisor type will reflect in Horizon like below.

#### Install required plugins

However changing the hypervisor type is just the first step. The communication
between XAPI and Nova services need to be set up like shown in the below
diagram. So we need to install some plugins.

Usually the best way to apply patches to XenServer hosts, or more precisely,
Dom0, is to pack the changed files into a XenServer supplemental pack and call
xe CLI to install it.

    xe-install-supplemental-pack /tmp/novaplugins-liberty.iso

Still, it's important that the different components are installed in the correct
order. The major steps can be install-pv-tool, install-dpkg-dependencies and
install-sup-pack. So the task dependencies look like this:

    - id: 'install-pv-tool'
      role: ['compute']
      required_for: ['compute-post-deployment']
      requires: ['post_deployment_start']
    - id: 'install-dpkg-dependencies'
      role: ['compute']
      required_for: ['compute-post-deployment']
      requires: ['post_deployment_start']
    - id: 'install-sup-pack'
      role: ['compute']
      required_for: ['post_deployment_end']
      requires: ['install-pv-tool', 'install-dpkg-dependencies']

More information about Fuel's hook mechanism can be found in
[deployment_tasks.yaml](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Fuel/Plugins#deployment_tasks.yaml).

#### Re-routing control networks

In XenServer, Host Internal Management Network (aka. HIMN) is a special internal
network which is used for communication between the Compute VM and the Dom0 that
it is running on.  The HIMN has the following characteristics:

* It is a built-in network isolated from others.
* It is invisible in XenCenter, as it should not normally need to be modified.
* It presents is DHCP service on the network, with a fixed dom0 IP address of
  `169.254.0.1`.

The HIMN is ideal for internal use and you don't have to spend effort on
setting up one. More importantly, Dom0 need to have access to OpenStack control
networks as well as Compute nodes do. If we forward control packets via HIMN,
that will be easier than setting up additional interfaces for Dom0. And in a
sense, Dom0 and Compute node can be regarded as one entity.

In order to make full use of the HIMN, and ensure that dom0 can access the
management networks set up by Mirantis Openstack, we need to configure the
Compute VM to masquerade packets from dom0 using NAT techniques.  Here is the
code. We create iptable rules in Compute nodes:

    sed -i s/#net.ipv4.ip_forward/net.ipv4.ip_forward/g /etc/sysctl.conf
    sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o br-storage -j MASQUERADE
    iptables -A FORWARD -i br-storage -o eth3 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A FORWARD -i eth3 -o br-storage -j ACCEPT
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o br-mgmt -j MASQUERADE
    iptables -A FORWARD -i br-mgmt -o eth3 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A FORWARD -i eth3 -o br-mgmt -j ACCEPT

`br-storage` and `br-mgmt` refer to OpenStack Storage network and Management
networks. They are the OpenStack control networks we talk about. Then we change
the default gateway in Dom0 for these two subnets:

    route add -net <mgmt_ip> netmask <mgmt_mask> gw <himn_ip>
    route add -net <storage_ip> netmask <mgmt_mask> gw <himn_ip>

#### Updating the OpenStack integration

This plugin is also be used to deliver bug fixes and new features, which are
being developed against OpenStack's trunk but are of significant importance to a
Mirantis 8.0 OpenStack deployment, which is based on a stable branch of
OpenStack:

* Neutron plugins : Neutron support for XenServer was introduced into upstream
  in Mitaka, cannot reflect in Mirantis Fuel 8 which uses Liberty.
* NoVNC proxy configuration : The XenServer VNC server runs on Dom0 but Mirantis
  Fuel assumes, by default, that it runs in Compute node.
* Guest console logs : Enabling serial consoles from guests requires a script
  to control disk usage and ensure the logs do not take unbounded space.
* Config drive configuration : Config drive should be set to the default option
  for file injection rather than libguestfs which is default for other 
  QEMU-based hypervisors.
* Validation for hotfix : XenServer supplemental pack XS65ESP1013 needs to be
  installed otherwise Virtual Block Device (VBD) connections could be mapped
  incorrectly.

#### Replacing the test image

The default test image "TestVM" is a qemu-specific cirros so need to be
replaced with one compatible with XenServer.

Please be noted that Fuel Health check, which will be covered in the next
chapter, always picks up the test image "TestVM" as the name is hard-coded.

    wget http://ca.downloads.xensource.com/OpenStack/cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-disk.vhd.tgz
    glance image-create --name "TestVM" \
      --container-format ovf --disk-format vhd \
      --property vm_mode="xen" --visibility public \
      --file "cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-disk.vhd.tgz"

In the latest XenServer Fuel plugin 3.1 (corresponding to MOS 8.0), the TestVM
image has been embedded in the plugin in case the deployment has no internet
connection.

#### Health check

Fuel Health Check, or OpenStack Testing Framework (OSTF), is one of greatest
advantages of Fuel. Fuel Health Check will go through the following categories
of automated tests, and take usually 20-40 minutes to estimate the availability
of a deployed environment.

    Sanity tests
    Functional tests
    HA tests
    Platform services functional tests
    Cloud validation tests
    Configuration tests

If everything goes right, you will get a result report like below:
