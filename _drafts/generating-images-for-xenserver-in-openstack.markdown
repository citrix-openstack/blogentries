Although OpenStack XenAPI supports some other disk formats, e.g. ami, raw, iso; VHD is the most commonly used and strongly recommended disk format. By comparing to raw disk, the occupied physical size can be much smaller than the virtual size with VHD. Actually VHD is the default disk format in XenServer OpenStack. This blog will focus on how to create images basing on VHD disk format; how to convert other types of disk format to VHD and finally how to create Windows images for XenServer in OpenStack.

# Generate Images from VHD images

For XenServer's OpenStack integration, the VHD disks should be contained in gzipped tarball, as we can support have multiple differencing disks (snapshots) from a single base VHD.  If the existing image is in this format already, we can import it to Glance image directly. Otherwise we need convert it to gzipped tarball firstly.

For example, there is a zipped VHD-based Ubuntu image at:

https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/vivid/current/vivid-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.vhd.zip

Let's see how to generate images from it.

* Firstly download image and extract vhd file from it.

  `wget https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/vivid/current/vivid-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.vhd.zip`

  `unzip vivid-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.vhd.zip`

Once we get vhd file, we can following the follow 2 steps to create the XenServer OpenStack image. This is a common procedure to create images from VHD files for XenServer OpenStack.

* rename vhd file and create gzipped tarball

  `mv vivid-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.vhd 0.vhd`\
  `tar -czf vivid-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.tgz 0.vhd`

* create image and import data to glance

  `glance image-create --name="Ubuntu-vivid-server-cloudimg-amd64" --is-public=true --container-format=ovf --disk-format=vhd --property vm_mode=hvm < vivid-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.tgz`

# Converting an existing QCOW2 image

Currently XenServer doesn't support QCOW2 images; but thankfully it's easy to convert QCOW2 to VHD based images by using qemu-img. We can download QCOW2 images from:

*https://getfedora.org/cloud/download/*

*https://uec-images.ubuntu.com/releases*

For example, we download Fedora qcow2 formatted image. We can use the following steps to generate the OpenStack image for XenServer:

`qemu-img convert -O vpc Fedora-Cloud-Base-23-20151030.x86_64.qcow2 0.vhd`\
`tar -czf Fedora-Cloud-Base-23-20151030.x86_64.tgz 0.vhd`\
`glance image-create --name="Fedora_23" --is-public=true --container-format=ovf --disk-format=vhd --property vm_mode=hvm < Fedora-Cloud-Base-23-20151030.x86_64.tgz`

At here I only take QCOW2 as the example, logically with the similar procedure we can create XenServer Images from any other images format as long as the images can be converted to VHD.

# Creating from an existing XenServer VM

If we have an existing VM running on XenServer, it's easy to create the image from this VM.

1. shutdown the VM

2. get VM's VDI and export it as VHD file. Usually that’s the first disk of the VM, so at here I use “device=xvda” to ensure only the first VBD is listed. If that’s not the first one, please identify it by yourself and specify the correct device.

   `vbd_uuid=$(xe vbd-list vm-name-label=<vm-name> device=xvda minimal=true)`\
   `vdi_uuid=$(xe vdi-list vbd-uuids=${vbd_uuid} minimal=true)`\
   `xe vdi-export format=vhd filename=0.vhd uuid=${vdi_uuid}`

3. Once we exported this VHD file, we can follow the same way described in the first section to generate the image.

   Note: There are also other ways to export the vhd file, e.g. copy vhd files directly from ext SR. But I strongly recommend to use vdi-export. It's a formal supported method by XenServer and it will generate compact VHD file with less file size (removed the zero contents from the VHD file).

# Creating a Windows image

In this section, I will try to describe how to create a Windows Image on XenServer. Please note this should be done on XenServer 6.5 or later and have all hotfixes installed (particularly the PV tools hotfixes).  The most recent PV tools will bind to multiple device_ids (see step 5 below), and therefore do not require special flags to be added to the image to set the device ID when creating a new VM.

 1. From XenCenter, create a VM.  When OpenStack creates a VM it does not have the per-distribution settings in the Template, so "Other install media" has a closer set of options to that presented by OpenStack. So at here we suggest you choose the option of "Other install media" which will give a default HVM template.

    Select the CD image to install from.  In this example, we are installing Windows 10 (64-bit)

    ![win10-install-2.png](/uploads/win10-install-2.png)

 2. Use Windows Updates to install the latest updates.  If you're using the Enterprise version of XenServer 7.0, then the PV drivers should also be automatically downloaded and installed for you (auto updating when new versions are released as well), so you can skip to step 6.

 3. Install PV driver from XenCenter:

    ![PVdriver-1.png](/uploads/PVdriver-1.png)

 4. Usually the above operation will insert the XS tools DVD into the DVD drive and finish the installation automatically; but for windows you may need to manually install the XS tools from the VM.

 5. Check that the device_id has not been set by the XenServer tools.

    Some versions of the PV drivers may set a device_id to the VM’s parameter of platform, even if it is not specified on the template. If a device_id is set on the VM during installation, OpenStack must have the proper device_id in the image's metadata so that the PV driver could bind xenbus driver to the correct platform device after the guest VM booted from this image. \
    In order to avoid potential issues, let’s ensure this parameter is not set (Actually with choosing "Other install media" as the template in step 1, it should be unset).

    `xe vm-param-list uuid=8f151bb3-4c90-3e65-94b3-5a9602380369 | grep device_id`

    If device_id is set, you can use the following command to unset it, but you may also need to re-install the PV drivers.

    `xe vm-param-remove param-name=platform param-key=device_id uuid=8f151bb3-4c90-3e65-94b3-5a9602380369`

 6. Add another Administrators account: The Window 10’s security strategy doesn’t allow the built-in Administrator to run Microsoft Edge which will be used to download cloudbase-init. The built-in Administrator will be hidden per Windows’s security strategy.

 7. After login with the new account (e.g. myadmin). Downloading and install the latest Cloudbase-Init version: https://cloudbase.it/downloads/CloudbaseInitSetup_Stable_x64.msi

    ![cloudbase-init-1.png](/uploads/cloudbase-init-1.png)

    ![cloudbase-init-2.png](/uploads/cloudbase-init-2.png)

 8. After cloudbase-init finished running Sysprep, it will shut down VM.

 9. Export VDI on XenServer:

    ![exportVDI.png](/uploads/exportVDI.png)

10. Create image and upload to glance:

    `tar -cvzf win10.tgz 0.vhd glance image-create --name="win10" --visibility=public --container-format=ovf --disk-format=vhd --property vm_mode=hvm --property os_type=windows <win10.tgz`

11. Create a new VM from the new image to verify this image.

    `nova boot --flavor 3 --image win10 --meta admin_pass=testVM1pass --nic net-id=0cb33381-e48b-444a-8709-fde15d4cab4e Win10-testVM1`

12. Login Windows with myadmin by using password as the one specified by “—meta admin_pass=”; check this VM’s hostname is Win10-testVM1 which is the VM name specified in the nova boot command.

# PV Guests

XenServer does, of course, support PV guests under OpenStack, and generation of these images is much the same as for HVM guests.  The key difference is when uploading them to glance, specify "--property vm_mode=xen" instead of hvm.

# Give it a go

XenServer-based OpenStack clouds are really easy to deploy using Mirantis OpenSTack and the XenServer Fuel plugin - check out our other blog posts like [Introduction to the XenServer Fuel Plugin](https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2016/07/11/introduction-to-xenserver-fuel-plugin/) or [Deploying Mirantis OpenStack on a single XenServer](https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2015/10/23/deploying-mirantis-openstack-on-a-single-xenserver/) - so it's never been easier to create and test your own XenServer OpenStack images.

Also, do check out XenServer 7.0 [enterprise edition ](https://docs.citrix.com/content/dam/docs/en-us/xenserver/xenserver-7-0/downloads/xenserver-7-0-licensing-faq.pdf) to get features like the Automated Windows VM Driver Updates to make your cloud easy to maintain.
