Following on from the plug-in built for previous versions of Mirantis OpenStack, we're thrilled that the plug-in written for Mirantis OpenStack 9.0 has now been certified and is available from the [validated solutions catalog](https://www.mirantis.com/validated-solution-integrations/fuel-plugins/)!

The combination of Mirantis OpenStack 9.0 and Citrix XenServer brings some great features and ease of use:

* Support for OpenStack Mitaka release - taking advantage of new features and stability improvements

* Mirantis OpenStack's Fuel deployment system - taking the pain of configuration and installation out of OpenStack.

* Run all OpenStack Services in Virtual Machines - Get all the advantages of virtualisation for your OpenStack infrastructure as well as the Tenant VMs

* Software defined networking for the OpenStack Service VMs with Named networks, VLANs and tunnels - take the guesswork out of provisioning your environment.

* Enterprise-level XenServer features, including:

  * Automatic management of the logo-certified Windows virtualised network and disk drivers.

  * Direct-Inspect APIs for better-than-physical virus, malware and hacker protection

  * Automatic hypervisor health checks, routinely running checks against your XenServer setup to notify you of actions needed to be taken
